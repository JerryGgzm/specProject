Characters
Chiikawa
A little critter who lives in a big house. Very small, cute and easily moved to tears, shy and scared of every monster they meet. However, they always try to be stronger, and be a good friend who helps their friends when they're in trouble. Recently, they are studying to obtain a 5th degree weeding certification (having already failed 2-3 times). They don't speak any human language, but rather use their own language. Chiikawa always says "Yada" and "Iyada," both of which are a childish way of saying "no" in Japanese.
